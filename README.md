# personal-website

A personal portfolio website written using sveltekit.

## About

### Intro Animation

Intro parallax animation was created by using a container with `position: sticky` and css values binded to sveltes `scrollY` value. All image assets were 3D rendered in blender. The animation was inspired by the intro animation from the website [The Goonies](https://the-goonies.webflow.io/). The foreground is a recreation of my childhood bedroom while the background is an improvement on the first blender render I ever created.

### Logo

A better version of a logo I created for myself back in grade 3. The text uses the Seconds font by Motokiwo.
