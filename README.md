A personal portfolio website written using sveltekit. 

## About

Intro parallax animation was created by using a container with `position: sticky` and css values binded to sveltes `scrollY` value. All image assets were 3D rendered in blender. The animation was inspired by the intro animation from the website [The Goonies](https://the-goonies.webflow.io/).
