## Installing a Package Manager

Commands differ between MacOS and Windows users. Be sure to use the correct commands.

For Windows Powershell (ensure you are in an **administrative shell**):

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'));
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

For MacOS: 

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Congratulations! You've now successfully installed a package manager.

## Installing the Required Packages

For Windows:

```bash
choco install git python vscode
```

For MacOS:

```bash
brew install git pyenv
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

Now you have python, vscode, and git installed on your machine. Depending on installation, your device may require a restart now.

## Installing VS Code Extensions

In VS Code, navigate to the Extensions tab and install the "Python Extension" as shown below:

## Using DWave

Navigate to the [D-Wave Leap](https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/signup/) website and create an account. Once you have an account, you can access the Leap IDE and run your code on a real quantum computer!

## Running Code!

Open vscode's terminal, pick any folder to work in, and clone the example code from the workshop:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redmac135/intro-quantum-computing.git
```

Next, create and use a python virtual environment using the python extension:

1. `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` to open the command palette.
2. Type `>Python: create Environment...` note the first character `>` should already be typed for you.
3. Choose `Venv` as the environment type.
4. Choose the first python version you see (it should be the latest version).
5. Select `requirements.txt` when asked which dependencies to install.

Now you should be able to run the terminal command `dwave setup --auth` to authenticate your account.

1. `Ctrl` + `` ` `` to open the terminal.
2. Type `dwave setup --auth` and press `Enter`.

This should open a browser window or give you a link to open in your browser. In the browser, you should log in with your LEAP account.

Finally, open the python file and run it! 

## Conclusion

Congrats! You've now run code on an actual quantum computer! ðŸŽ‰
